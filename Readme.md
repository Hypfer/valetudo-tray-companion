Valetudo Tray Companion offers a tray icon, which on right-click provides you with a list of Valetudo instances on your network.
Clicking on one of them will open its Webinterface in your default browser.

Discovery is done via the Bonjour/mDNS broadcasts of Valetudo.

## Installation

Simply download the latest binary from the releases section and execute it.<br/>
If you want to "install" it for permanent use, just copy the executable to a persistent location such as your `%USERPROFILE%` on windows or `~` on linux and select the "Run on startup" menu option.
